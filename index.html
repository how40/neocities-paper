                    <p>I begin with a question:</p>
                    <p>Q: What do Hollywood, Wall Street, Area 51, Paris, Tokyo, and the Colosseum have in common?</p>
                    <center><img src="/neocities-paper/question.gif"></center>
                    <p>Your mind might go to the fact that these are all real locations in our world. But that is not the answer I have in mind.</p>
                    <p>A: These six locations were all neighborhoods in the early internet website hub GeoCities.</p>

                    <p>Originating in 1994 as Beverly Hills Internet ("Beverly Hills Internet"), the soon-renamed GeoCities offered early internet users the ability to make and host their own websites. Financial and technical barriers towards digital creation were mitigated through the platform’s free hosting and user-friendly organization.</p>
                    <center><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/19970330101549/http://www5.geocities.com:80/pictures/sponsor/homebb.gif"></center>
                    <p>In decidedly pre-Internet language, co-founder David Bohnett explained GeoCities to Business Wire in 1995:</p>
                    <blockquote> 
                        <span>“Our goal in bridging cyberspace and reality is to attract netters who want to colonize the web -- to put down roots in a GeoCity they feel comfortable and familiar with to call home, where they can express themselves, create their own content, build their own neighborhoods," ("Beverly Hills Internet")
                        </span>
                        <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Falchetron.com%2Fcdn%2Fdavid-bohnett-9259dd6f-20e3-4a7a-be7b-2ba6b56ded8-resize-750.jpeg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=c191e2a671ad855ae52f1c18cd231b50b84f3667704b8f665fe86c999b564e08&ipo=images">
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>GeoCities offered structure through sectioning user-hosted websites into “neighborhoods”, each tailored to specific interests, each with sub-neighborhoods of their own:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hollywood: entertainment</li>
                            <li>Wall Street: finance and economics</li>
                            <li>Area 51: science-fiction and fantasy</li>
                            <li>Paris: romance, the arts, poetry</li>
                            <li>and many more.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <div style="display:flex;gap:30px">
                        <div id="left">
                            <p>In 1999, near the apex of the dot-com bubble, Yahoo! acquired GeoCities for $3.57 billion. ("Yahoo pulls the plug") Between corporate mismanagement and a cultural shift towards platforms like MySpace and Facebook, the platform had lost much of its market share and relevance. (Raphael) </p>
                            <p>Yahoo! announced GeoCities’ U.S. closure in April 2009, and with it over 38 million web pages – the majority of which coded by hand – were taken offline. <img src="https://www.animated-smileys.com/emoticons/animated-smileys-sad-002.gif.pagespeed.ce.gUxU6C2iVK.gif"></p>

                    <p>
                        Four years later, in May 2013, developer Kyle Drake founded GeoCities “modern spiritual successor” (Garrity),  Neocities. An open-source, ad-free, static HTML hosting site with the goal of “making the internet fun again” ("Neocities - About”).
                    </p>
                    <center><img src="https://neocities.org/img/neocities-Logo.png" width="200px"></center>
                    <p>
                        But while Neocities at first glance might seem like a novelty, a GeoCities pastiche capitalizing on late-90’s and early-’00s nostalgia, the platform holds significant power today as a tool for creative expression, an outlet for spreading information in the face of algorithmic control, and a hub for democratizing web design in the modern era.

                    <center>
                        <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091027010422/http://de.geocities.com/pejanet24/divider1032.gif"> </br>
                        <h2>What is Neocities?</h2>
                    </center>

                    <p>There is perhaps no better way to understand Neocities than to simply look through the website.</p>

                    <img src="/home.gif">

                    <p>At the top of the homepage is a sign-up form. After making an account, their URL is created: username.neocities.org. At this point, one is brought to a file dashboard. Users get 1 free gigabyte to host their site and the ability to create documents – HTML files, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts, and more – entirely in-browser.</p>

                    <p>In the ‘Websites’ and ‘Activities’ tabs, users can look through other Neocities sites, following ones they like. After following websites, their updates will show up on one’s ‘Feed’. Here, one can comment on site updates and engage with the close-knit Neocities community. The “Learn” tab gives a rudimentary introduction to HTML and CSS through a cheeky web-comic, with a list of resources at the end for anyone interested in learning more.</p>

                    <p>Aptly described in Cristel Kolopaking’s 2013 article “From Geo to Neo: Can NeoCities Provide a Creative Utopia for Contemporary Web Culture?”:</p>

                    <blockquote>“NeoCities seems to exist in limbo between the neighbourhood-based communities of GeoCities in its idealised stage, and the follow/friend system used by most current social media.” (Kolopaking)</blockquote>

                    <p>Indeed, Neocities is a decidedly 21st-century hybrid of static HTML websites and feed-based social networks.</p>

                    <p>Here are some of my favorite websites I’ve encountered in my time with Neocities:</p>

                    <img src="/neocities-paper/sites.gif">

                </div>
                <div id="good-bad-ugly">
                    <center>
                        <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091027010422/http://de.geocities.com/pejanet24/divider1032.gif"> </br>
                        <h2>The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</h2>
                    </center>
                    
                    <h3>The Good</h3>

                    <h4>Creative expression</h4>

                    <p>As one might surmise from the list of websites above, creativity is at the center of Neocities. Sites are hand-coded, leading to a wide range of design. While many sites do mimic the GIF-filled, tiled background homepages of GeoCities, just as many adapt nostalgic design for modern user sensibilities.</p>
            
                    <p>In an interview with Kyle Drake, Sean Garrity from HostingAdvice.com commented on the significance of Neocities’ open-end structure:</p>

                    <blockquote>“Provided with a blank canvas, webmasters are not only encouraged to learn about web design, but are pushed to exercise their own creativity in lieu of copying the design of pre-existing sites. With no pre-loaded templates to work with, bloggers must become their own experts on web design, creating a product that is 100% their own invention.” (Garrity)</blockquote>
                    
                    <h4>Open source, ad-free</h4>

                    <p>There are no ads on Neocities – the platform is run entirely through donations and premium account subscriptions. While Neocities’ free plan is sufficient for most users, the $5/month supporter plan provides 50 gigabytes of storage, higher bandwidth, and the ability to use custom URLs.</p>
                    
                    <p>The entire backend for Neocities is available to see on Github as well. Neocities does not sell its users’ data and champions a sustainable growth model. Choices like these may seem trivial to the average internet user, but they hold great significance in understanding the values of the platform. Neocities, from its very structure, seeks to empower and respect its users.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Counters algorithm-driven platforms</h4>

                    <p>Neocities’ emphasis on user creativity alongside open-source autonomy allows the sites it hosts a degree of independence seldom seen on major platforms like Reddit or Instagram. The Neocities culture of ‘webrings’, where users link their favorite websites on their page, as well as the five custom tags one can put on their site, foster organic discovery of real people’s websites – a stark contrast to the search-engine optimized, AI-generated pages that flood search engines today.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Bad</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Learning curve</h4>

                    <p>The blank-canvas structure core to Neocities is a double-edged sword. Yes, the platform’s open-ended nature affords a level of customization seldom seen on traditional social media. At the same time, one gets as much out of Neocities as they put into it. There is a learning curve to making an HTML website. Not a large hurdle, but a hurdle nevertheless. Creating an account on Instagram or starting a column on Substack is simply easier for most.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Easy to learn, hard to master</h4>

                    <p>HTML is an intuitive, simple-to-learn language. Nearly anyone with experience on the Internet could make a static website with ease. But there is a difference between knowing how to make a website and knowing how to make a good-looking website. Some level of time and skill is required to make complex and/or visually appealing websites. With the plethora of free resources available online, anyone passionate about their site could learn web design – but again, that is a hurdle that some people have no interest in jumping (and there is nothing wrong with that either.)</p>
                    
                    <h4>Limited visibility</h4>
                    <p>The internet is incomprehensibly large. How does Google or Bing prioritize the best, most relevant websites to show up first? The answer is search engine optimization (SEO) – though this technique manifests itself in different ways across the Internet.</p>

                    <p>In "A Brief Review on Search Engine Optimization”, Dushyant Sharma et al. describe “White Hat” and “Black Hat” SEO: the former refers to optimizing HTML, producing high-quality content, and following Google’s SEO guidelines to obtain long-term growth; the latter refers to exploiting Google’s page ranking system by using loopholes (e.x. Using hidden text, ‘stuffing’ one’s page with target keywords, or sending different information to the search engine vs. the user).</p>
                    
                    <p>What this means for Neocities users is that relying solely on search engines to gain visibility is difficult. One must share their Neocities website on other social media platforms to find an audience… which, to many, might mitigate the entire purpose of making a website to begin with.</p>
                    
                    <div id="ugly">

                        <h3>The Ugly</h3>

                        <h4>The Wild West</h4>
                            <p>Neocities, similar to its predecessor, is a decentralized platform driven by its users. While this helps foster a great level of creative autonomy, it also evokes many of the same challenges of the “wild west” era of Web 1.0. A lack of centralized content moderation means that what users create is entirely at their discretion.</p>

                            <p>This freedom, while empowering, can also result in the proliferation of hate speech, NSFW content, and misinformation. In contrast to mainstream social media platforms with strict content policies, Neocities places responsibility in the hands of individual webmasters.</p>

                            <h4>Security and Privacy</h4>
                            <p>Neocities’ openness can also pose a threat to one’s privacy on the Internet. Indeed, your account is your URL, and anyone with a Wi-Fi connection can visit your website. A degree of restraint in sharing one’s personal information is essential, and in an age where privacy controls are often built-in to a social media platform, beginners might forget just how visible their information is.</p>

                            <p>As well, novice users could inadvertently expose their sites to vulnerabilities. The flexibility that NeoCities offers for self-hosted, hand-coded projects can be a double-edged sword: while it encourages learning and experimentation, it also leaves room for critical mistakes. With great power comes great responsibility.</p>

                <div id="why-conclusion">
                    <center>
                        <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091027010422/http://de.geocities.com/pejanet24/divider1032.gif"> </br>
                        <h2>Why Does Neocities Matter?</h2>
                    </center>
                    <p>In the introduction to Svetlana Boym’s <i>The Future of Nostalgia</i>, the author opines on the qualities of wistful nostalgia, saying,</p>
                    <blockquote>“The nostalgic desires to obliterate history and turn it into private or collective mythology, to revisit time like space, refusing to surrender to the irreversibility of time that plagues the human condition.” (Boym 15)</blockquote>
                    <p>I believe Neocities harnesses the power of nostalgia to this end – morphing an unreachable history into a craftable mythology, a stark defiance against the transience of our modern Internet.</p>

                    <p>But Neocities does not live and die by its ability to mimic a long-dead platform. Its creator said so himself upon Neocities’ release in 2013:</p>
                    <blockquote>“The purpose of this project is not to inspire nostalgia. It’s to rebuild the platform for us to be able to be creative again. To have sites that we can do whatever we want with. This is not nostalgia speaking. We really did lose our platforms for creativity and rich self expression online, and I want to help bring them back.” (“Making the Web Fun Again”)</blockquote>

                    <p>Certainly, Neocities has held to this belief in the eleven years of its existence – and the message has not fallen on deaf ears. One year after launch, the platform had 19,000 users (<i>“Neocities, one year later.”</i>). Today, that number is up to 919,000 ("Neocities"). There is an undeniable desire for creative autonomy online, and Neocities is helping to fill that hole.</p>

                    <p>Will Neocities continue to adapt and grow sustainably? The platform has already been around for two-thirds of GeoCities’ lifespan, so I am inclined to say yes. Each and every day, more research comes out about the sinister aspects of our hegemonic social media, the rampant spread of misinformation, and its long-term implications on our mental health. Arguably, the need for a no-strings-attached communication platform has only grown stronger since Neocities began in 2013. While it certainly is not perfect, Neocities provides a valuable resource to Internet users disillusioned by modernity. And as long as the world wide web exists, there will always be people looking for their own piece of digital land to call home.</p>
